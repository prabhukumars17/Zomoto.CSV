Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is the best place for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. Currently, it stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain, and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims at analyzing the demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarities between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurants which will help in finding the overall rating for the place.
